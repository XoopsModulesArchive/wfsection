- Path configuration dialog: removed "Attached Files Upload Temp Path: This path is no longer required and will be removed."
- WF-Sections tries to create thumbnail folders if they don´t exist now
- file upload issues fixed with using mimetype system from wf-downloads now
- Server stats information section added for easier troubleshooting
- several irritating text string appearances remove when 'Database succesfully updated' is displayed
- fixed some issues with import of word files  (note: this requires com extension enabled in your php). Still some issues left but should work better now.
- Xoops Admin Area:  Fixed context menu for the wf-sections button
- regrouped layout of wf-sections admin area. (Upper bar general options, lower bars content related functions)
- fixed URL issues in several files and templates with using $xoops_url instead of $xoopsurl
- fixed a bug listing all articles listed when selecting a non existent category
- fixed a bug were documents when changed where not listed as submitted and the changes were not stored despite the message saying 'DB updated succesfully'
- did a massive clean out in language defines. Removed lots of unused defines
- changed many variable, function and define names to prevent problems when running wf-sections side by side with several other modules (e.g. X-IPB, newbb2 ...)
- admin section: renamed 'HTML Import' button to 'Import document' as it can import html / php / txt and word files
- server error 500 fixed. This was caused by eating up lots of memory on screens retrieving a userlist with xoops function because it retrieved all user data not only the names so we rewrote this function
- prevent authors email adress from being displayed if he has set it not to be displayed to others in his user profile
- using shortened 'Section title' in blocks now to prevent messing up of the screen layout

- added page management function to allow easy creation and modification of WF-Sections pages (e.g. adding removing WF-Sections logos)
- changed column type for the article text from "text" to "mediumtext" in the database it can use max. 16mb instead of 64kb for the text.
