- myblocksadmin -


SUMMARY:

This files add blocks admin into your module.


BACKGROUND:

XOOPS's admin of blocks and groups will be hard to use,
when many modules is installed.
If each module has the block management screen for itself,
webmasters using XOOPS will feel it easy, I think.
I will recommend it to the module developers by all means.


HOW TO USE:

1) copy 4 files of
     myblocksadmin.php
     mygroupperm.php
     mygrouppermform.php
     admin.php
   into modules/(your module)/admin/
   (this admin.php is compatible for mymenu)

2) copy blocksadmin.inc.php into modules/(your module)/include

3) edit admin/menu.php and append a menu item like this:

	$adminmenu[] = array( 'title' => _MI_SYSTEM_ADMENU2 ,
	                      'link' => "admin/myblocksadmin.php" ) ;

That's all !
